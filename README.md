Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Okay , Software Engeneering is a way of modelling a software to meet up a high standard of user and system specifications 
It has really helped in the advancement of the technology industry by introducing innovations and updates on the most recennt and advance systems like AI( Artificial Itelligence ) making human task more meaningful and faster . There is high productivity through the introduction of AI and giving human more space to solve greater problems .

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of AI ( Artificial Itelligence ) example : COPILOT
Introduction of OS ( Operating Systems ) example : ANDRIOD
It has paved way to make Software Engineering a descipline to study in schools 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements : this are what the system expects from the user
Design : this is like the arrangement of data 
Testing : is checking all conponents to be sure it meets the standard 
Deploying : giving or sharing the software to users 
Maintanance : to update or add new specifications 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a process that happens in sequence flowing downwards while Agile is an interacxtive approch based on gflexibility MEANING on the waterfall is a process that you take from one to another WHILE agile is flexible MEANING there can be space to Edit 
Example of waterfall : Requirement to Design
Example of Agile : Scince its a flexible Approach you can go from the  Design to the Maintainance and back to Testing

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineernce , and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer    : is person who writes code and inplements software ideas
Quality Assurance Engineer : it make sure that the quality of software is good by desighnining and executing test plan
Project Manager : is in Charge of the planning , execution and delivery of software systems 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(IDEs) ;they provide easy to undrestand tools for writting , debbuging and testing codes . Example is visual studio real life Scenerio is making Beats for Music and Eclipse
(VCS) ;  this a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work amomg team members Example is ; Github like i am here now and Subversion



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical Debt : the project manager should review extensivelly and prioritization of task 
Tight Deadlines : early review and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT : this is individual texting of a conponentthis is testing the software against user needs to be sure it meeyts user specifications    of software 
INTERGRATION : this is the testing interaction between different component 
SYSTEM : you are now testing the whole system as whole computer 
ACCEPTANCE : this is testimg the softwaere against user requirements to be sure it meets users needs 
INPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE ; THEY HELP TO IDENTIFY AND FIX DEFECTS EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engeneering is a special recipe given to a Robot . it is knowing and directing the AI to solve a particular problem 
INPORTANCE IN INTERACTING WITH AI MODELS : 1 . It giges a clear command to your robot and a clear command is = a clear feedback 
                                           2 . it makes a Conputer to act like a Human by doing basic task Reapeteadly giging the human more space to concentrate on the greater task 
                                           
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VOUGUE PROMPT : WHAT IS CANDY 
INPROVING : TELL ME WHAT A CANDY IS MADE FROM AND HOW IT IS BEIGN PRODUCED TO HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
THE INPROVED PROMPT IS MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE I HAVE DIRECTED THE AI TO GET ME A MORE DEEPER AND DETAILED ANSWER TO MY PROMPT MAKING IT MORE CREATIVE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE AND BROADER
